					<p><em>'Drinks
With' is an occasional series providing a glimpse into the lives of
prominent Madisonians. The transcribed interview is here, a shortened
version appeared in the newspaper.</em></p><p><strong>Who is he?</strong>
Owner of ZD Studios, Mark Schmitz is the visual design man behind the
look of Lambeau Field - and continues work there on a project that will
be unveiled this summer as a tribute to Brett Favre. His projects
include Camp Randall, State Street, Hilldale Shopping Center
revitalization and the new UW Children's Hospital. Schmitz' roots in
Madison are deep, but he was also just hired by the Miami Dolphins to
help with the team's stadium renovations.</p><p><strong>Hangout of choice:</strong> Barriques Coffee Trader, Downtown</p>
				
				</div>
				


				<div class="wsjstorybody2">
				
					<p><strong>His drink:</strong> Mark West Pinot Noir</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> So you said there's a reason you picked this spot.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong>
I picked the Loraine because I bought a condo upstairs. I wanted to
invest in the revitalization of Downtown Madison. It's a fort, a place
for clients who come to town to stay. My grandpa and grandma Schmitz
had their first formal date, right here in this building.(The ballroom
when it was the Loraine Hotel.)</p><p>I started working Downtown on the
Square in 1991. But I grew up in Madison. My grandfather Schmitz was a
dentist here above Badger Candy Kitchen in 1924. He built a chicken
coop on the back of his truck because often when he was paid in the
Depression it was with chickens. My dad's dad was the dentist on the
Square and my mom's dad . . . started a little insurance company and
moved it to Madison in the '30s and changed the name to American Family
Insurance in the '50s.</p><p>The short time we've been alive in our
generation, we've seen a lot of change technically. But the generation
twice before us, what they had to go through - with war, it's
absolutely extrodinary what they lived through physically. Versus, "oh
my iPod is clashing with my cell phone" and that kind of thing. "Ohhh,
we don't have wireless Internet here, oh." Compare that to when you're
pulling teeth and someone throws two chickens in the back of your
truck. And you get eggs for a week before you eat the hen. It's a very
strange life.</p><p>It's the Midwestern culture and our work ethic. I
have ancestry obviously with Schmitz. But then the Webster side, my
grandfather Webster was one of the founders of American Family
Insurance and started that business with his good friend Mr. (Herman)
Whittwer in Ripon, Wisconsin right after World War I. He ran away from
home when he was 17 with his identical twin brother. And lied about his
age at the draft board in Stevens Point and were put into the cavalry
as infantry soldiers and shipped over to France in 1918. He was 17
years old at the time and lied about his age and at that time there was
a huge rallying to go and fight for our country. Every 18-year-old kid
in the country wanted to go to war and to be a part of that experience.
And they left and the troop transport made it to France, but the horse
transport that had a division worth of horses on it was torpedoed and
sunk and every horse died. So all these cavalry soldiers got there and
they had no horses. So they were trained as gunners and were
immediately put on the front lines in combat. And my grandpa, right
before he died, he was honored by President Reagan as one of the last
living survivors of the Battle of Chateau-Thierry and the Battle of the
Argonne in World War I. That was my mom's dad.</p><p>My dad's dad was
the dentist on the Square and my mom's dad was the kid who got back and
survived the war and survived six months in the occupational army in
Germany and came back and started selling stocks and commitments to
lumberjacks in Wisconsin and Michigan.</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> Did your one grandfather ever treat the other grandfather for dental work?</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong>
They might have. Those were two great entrepreneurial men who I've
admired my whole life and I was very lucky to know them as a kid. I
knew both my grandfathers very, very well. I was in my late '20s when
they died and they lived here in Madison and I was here, so I really
got to know them very well. I think that sent a tone for an
entrepreneurial spirit of pushing for success and trying to make things
happen. Not just for family and staff but for the city of Madison. The
forming of this city over the decades is pretty amazing.</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> It's great to be able to trace family history like that.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong>
That's why we're sitting at the Loraine today. My grandpa and grandma
Schmitz had their first formal date, right here in this building.</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> What was it then?</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong>
It was the hotel. It was a very, very beautiful hotel with a big
second-floor mezzanine and a ballroom and they had a dance. My
grandmother was a public school teacher and they met at the state
teachers' convention in Milwaukee.</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> So you have generations of history here.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> As a kid it was important and they talked about that. They made a big deal of it.</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> You grew up in Madison?</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong>
Yes, I grew up on the West Side right near Odana Golf Course. I was
born right down at the bottom of the hill here at Madison General,
which is now Meriter. My family moved out to High Point Road before
West Towne was built, which was a four-day drive, days and nights, to
get out to High Point Road at that time. I moved there in 1972 so I was
nine years old. And that's where I lived through high school.</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> Where did you go to high school?</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> I went to Verona High School. I should have gone to Memorial, but I chose to go to Verona.</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> Hey, what's wrong with Memorial? I went there.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong>
Nothing. Nothing's wrong with Memorial. But I was really involved in
playing junior tennis when I was a kid and John Powless was my coach. I
had made close friends with kids in Verona who were on the Verona
tennis team. We literally called up the Verona School District and
said, "Hey we live on High Point Road, but if my kids walk to the
bottom of the hill, can they go to school in Verona?" And that was it -
that was all we had to do to switch school districts. Think about it
now. My dad just called the Superintendent of Schools and asked if the
bus could swing by and pick us up.</p><p>High Point Road was where the Big Sky Theater was - it was in the middle of nowhere.</p><p>I
had to leave here for five years to come back and do this. I needed to
leave Madison to understand that Madison is really a place where I
wanted to be.</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> When did you leave and where did you go?</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong>
I left to go to Boulder, Colorado, in 1987. After college. After
working as a set designer/lighting guy at RW Video in Madison - where
Pacific Cycle is now - in the video/film production business. I was in
love at the time, and still am, with an amazing girl named Julie who is
my present wife of 17 years. And we decided we needed to move to a
neutral city where there weren't any skeletons or old girlfriends and
boyfriends walking around and no one knew us. So we moved to Boulder. I
worked in Denver - I got my first real job in Denver at an ad agency
there. And I made the commute from Denver to Boulder every single day
for two years, which was a long commute but it was a wonderful two
years. We were totally broke and lived on the floor and had a cardboard
box for a dining table and didn't have a dime. It was a big deal when
we could buy a quart of beer for dinner on a Friday night.</p><p>So we
started off sleeping on a foam mattress and eating on a cardboard box.
And we moved from there to Stevens Point, of all places. I was trying
to get a job in Chicago and I was sending resumes to Chicago and trying
to set up interviews there. And then one day a guy called me from
Stevens Point and said, "I'm about 500 miles away from where you want
to be, but I've got a very unique opportunity with a unique ad agency
up here and would you be interested in talking to me?"</p><p>I was 23,
making $16,000 a year and that to me was rich. And I took a risk and he
took a risk and went to Stevens Point and got involved in an agency
called The Agency and we did everything to do with the outdoor industry
stuff - fishing, all that kind of stuff, which is not really who I am.
I am kind of a downtown guy, not a hunting-and-fishing kind of guy. But
I absolutely adored the people and the product and what we did. And in
two years and nine-months I learned how to run a small trade shop. I
was really at the front line of learning how to make it happen. I guess
I learned the confidence of how to run my own business when I was there.</p><p>And
then in 1991 we moved back to Madison and started working with two
women who had a design firm down on King Street, a multi-media kind of
thing. In 1994 I bought a computer and a lease and I was in business
for myself. So on June 1st, 1994, was day one of my ZD Studios. We had
three people and a lot of debt. In 12 years we've gone from three
people to 20 people and have never made a sales call. Have never gone
in and told anybody, "This is what I do, can I do it for you?" It's
100% referral business. It's the passion of what I do that is
contagious sometimes.</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> And now you're doing some work for the Miami Dolphins? How'd that come about?</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong>
I'm sitting right here, having coffee 9 o'clock on a Friday morning.
Bryan Wiedmeier called. He said, "Hey Mark, Bryan Wiedmeier, president
of the Miami Dolphins. How are you doing?" And I'm thinking, "This is a
joke. It's my friend Dave calling me to joke." I go, "I'm great how are
you?" He says, "Well we've seen everything you've done at Lambeau Field
and we've seen and experienced the visualness and the texture of
Lambeau Field." He said "texture" and my reaction was "My God, this guy
gets it. And it's Friday morning and he's calling me at Barriques. This
is not a joke."</p><p>He said, "I really want to talk to you about a
couple of major projects we have going on down here and I'd like to get
you down here as soon as we can." I thought OK, I have two other client
meetings in Florida next week - we're doing a big resort in Fort Meyers
Beach right now - and I thought I could go from there to Miami and meet
him. And he said, "No, I need you here before that." And I thought, two
weeks is not enough, you need me here next week? And he said, "yup."</p><p>So
I (spent) two full days with the Dolphins administration and staff and
architects and the like to be fully brought up to speed with their $300
million renovations to Dolphin Stadium. And they said, we want you to
create the whole visual culture of the facility - concessions,
restaurants, retail, Hall of Fame - all of it.</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> You did Camp Randall as well, correct?</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong>
Yes, Camp Randall and we also have done other destination resorts, a
Westin in Scottsdale. We're doing the Neptune Inn down, which is down
in Fort Myers Beach. The Pabst Farm development - if you're familiar
with it - 2,000-acre development we're doing all the brand development
for that. We're getting involved in creating human experiences, visual
events, human events in spaces. We are doing the whole redevelopment of
Hilldale - visual graphic planning, signing, we've been working on that
for over a year.</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> You the one to thank for getting Sundance here?</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong>
No, no, but I like to think that what I did got Sundance here. My
friend got that - it's really a big coup for Madison. It really is.
That's what needed to happen in order for Joseph Freed &amp; Associates
and all those guys to do right by Madison. And they knew that. So Whole
Foods is moving up the street. That whole neighborhood is going to
completely change so much for the better - Midvale, Shorewood -
Hilldale has always been the heart of that area. And it's been kind of
a weak heart the past couple of years. And now it's going to be a new
dynamic. The restaurants, the unique boutique retail. The accessibility
to it with parking and with all the amenities. It's really going to be
an amazing place. It's what Greenway Station wanted to be. It's going
to be great. A good project, wonderful people to work with and we were
honored to do that.</p><p>We helped to do the renovation on State
Street and create the banner planning and light poles and working with
the design team on State Street was really an honor, really special to
be selected with the four design companies. So from city spaces and
commons areas and outside environments to virtual, immersive Web design
environmental work to interior theme and resale to NFL stadiums. We're
effecting the circle of an experience. It's a full circle. We're not an
ad agency in any way. We don't do campaign stuff. We do things of
permanence, things of substance and things that are positive to our
environment.</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> How do you describe your job to people?</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> It's hard.</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> I'm gathering that.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong>
We are a visual development firm. One that specializes in comprehensive
experiences for products and places and services. Not related to
advertising, but related to brand. But brand is such a horrible word
right now. It's awful.</p><p>You know what is funny, we just had a
staff meeting this afternoon and we're struggling with the same thing -
how do you tell your grandma what you do? You have to show her a
picture of Lambeau Field and say, 'That's what I do.' You can't just
describe it.</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> It funny because I've seen your
name, but when someone recommended you as someone to sit down and have
Drinks With . . . they were trying to describe you and they said you
work with landscape. Like a landscape architect, but more, bigger. I'm
thinking plants and trying to track you down. I found a landscape
architect in Florida named Mark Schmitz.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong>
That's funny. It's true, visual landscape. From 1994 to now, I've
always been really fascinated by feature design and fashion design and
always wanted to be involved in both of those. Ink on paper and logo
design - we do a lot of that - integrated brand type of thing. The word
integration is really important. Providing integrated visual landscape.
Hey, you're helping me. I did work in landscaping by the way, a college
job, best summer because I had the best tan and was in the best shape
of my life. I used to go to Tom Foolery's and hang out over there - a
weird big-hair, black light nightclub in the early '80s across from
Memorial. It used to be Barnaby's when we were kids.</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> Where are you going with ZD Studios?</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong>
The future of where we're going is really bright in that the visual
human experience is becoming so important to be successful in retail or
in renovation of a condominium project or a stadium project or an
entertainment destination. The melding of interior design and brand
design into one is really an important thing. We do the brand design
and meld it into the interior design and it's becoming a very powerful
thing. And doing that for more and more large, public spaces.</p><p>We
go to a ballgame now, it's not like buying a ticket and going to sit in
the bleachers, it's a major entertainment experience now. You have only
so much discretionary income for entertainment so the symphony competes
with the Badger hockey game. The Badger football game competes with a
Brewers' game. All of these venues are about much more than game day.
It's all about making money and driving traffic on non-game day into
your restaurants and your entertainment zones so that you get the
experience of Brewer baseball, but there's not a game going on on the
field. You can have lunch in TGI Fridays and hang out over the field.
These facilities have been empty 354 days a year, empty, dead. So you
spend $200 million on a building that is going to be empty for every
day except 10 days a year? That doesn't add up anymore.</p><p>So down
goes the big empty house and on to that goes the retail and the
restaurants and all the stuff on to the stadium so you can use it every
day of the year. That's happening throughout baseball, football,
basketball. Every professional and collegiate sport is having to go
through, "How do we use that space when nobody's here?" How can we
bring tourists down to Camp Randall in the middle of the summer, have
them go to a concession stand and get a Wisconsin brat and go in
Bucky's Locker Room and buy something fun about the stadium and then
walk down a big, long hallway and learn about the history of the
grounds and the Civil War?</p><p>What will someday happen in Camp
Randall is it will be someplace you can go to the first week in June
and have a full Badger athletic experience, but there's nothing going
on on the field. That is a critical component to keeping these venues
alive and in business. Ticket sales on game day are important but
they're not what keep a place alive.</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> What's your favorite project you've ever done in Wisconsin?</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong>
(Very long pause.) Boy, I have to say Lambeau Field. I just have to
because of the significance of the history there. We went through the
process of five years.</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> That's how long it took?</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong>
Yeah, five years, and we're still doing it. We're doing a big exhibit
for the 10-year anniversary of the Super Bowl - we're doing a major
room design and exhibit design for the Green Bay Packer Hall of Fame
right now that will open on June 1st of this year. It will also be a
way to honor Brett Favre. That's not to say that he's leaving yet.</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> You sure you don't want to reveal that here?</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong>
No, if Brett were prepping for that, I would not be saying that, no.
But I think that if you look at the Super Bowl of 1996, it was when he
came of age and won the Super Bowl. So we're redesigning an entire room
in the Packers Hall of Fame that will be very exciting and interactive
once it's open. That's a current project that is very exciting.</p><p>Another
project I'm very excited about is we've been asked to do all the
interpretive signing and the brand design for the Children's Hospital.
That's a very special, special project. That's clearly the most
meaningful project I've ever been a part of. Helping families of sick
kids and sick kids live and love the environment they're going to be in
when they are at the hospital. It's a very large project that will take
three years to do and when it's done it will be a facility that will be
like no other facility in the country.</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> That's interesting, given that it's named for American Family, which is tied to your roots here.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong>
Isn't that weird? American Family gave a $10 million gift to the
funding and to do the naming rights on it. It's a little weird to have
an insurance company name a hospital, but isn't in the vein in any way.
It's a really special thing. So all those years of listening to my mom
and my Uncle Chuck Webster, of Webster &amp; Webster Insurance. All
those years of being told, 'Mark, if you want to go into the insurance
business, it's the family business and it's all yours.' I very
honorably and politely took my own path.</p><p><strong>MC:</strong>What did you think you wanted to be when you were a kid? It can't be this, given that it's almost too hard to describe.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong>
I wanted to be an architect. I wanted to be frogman, an architect and a
professional skier - in that order. Frogman, which is the WWII covert
name for skin divers that would dress up in their camouflage and dive -
Johnny Quest kind of thing.</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> Do you ski?</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> Oh, yes.</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> Is that your number one hobby?</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong>
Number one hobby would be golf. I'm pretty obsessed with that. I think
if you're an average white guy in your 40's you get obsessed with golf.
Girls will get it too.</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> I can't golf.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> Your husband will.</p><p><strong>MC:</strong>He'd rather review video games.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong>
He reviews video games? That's cool. We're going to do Raven Software's
new Web site. That's another really cool thing, we were just selected
by Raven to redesign their entire Web presence and we start April 15th.
I'm very excited about that. I went to high school with Brian Raffel.
Not that it had anything to do with why they selected us. I used to
date his sister Ann.</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> And yet he still hired you?</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> He did.</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> Brian has a great story too, starting from his garage or basement, building a hugely successful company.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong>
I remember in high school art classes and independent stuff when I was
a senior. Brian was two years old than me but I remember seeing his
stuff. He was such a great illustrator. He drew all those weird
monster, animal things when he was younger.</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> What are you doing for Raven?</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong>
In addition to their Web site, we'll help them with their recruiting.
What's the message that needs to go out there to a 20-year-old kid that
has never had a girlfriend that is the ultimate gamer and they want to
get him to come and work in Madison. I don't know. We're going to work
on that. Some of these guys are just brilliant. It will be wonderful to
work on a Web site for someone I knew as a kid and our businesses 30
years later come together. That's a great story of people who decided
to stay here and raise families and be in a culture that we love and
that's important.</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> You said golf is number one, what else do you do</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong>
Golf. Kids - I have three kids. Riley who is 9 and twins that are 7. I
was afflicted with twins. No fertility drugs or anything, amazing.
Greta and Cole - a girl and a boy. Magically funny children who are all
blessed with extraordinary senses of humor. It's what makes the stress
stuff work. It makes it okay. You get to go home and Riley's got and
idea for the Raven Web site. I share this stuff with them. Cole is a
psycho football fanatic. And he knows all the statistics. He was a
little upset when I said we were going to go meet with the Dolphins. He
said, "Dad, the Dolphins are weak. Weak - it's a fish. It's weak." Then
Riley said, "It's not a fish, it's a mammal." But they can relate to
this kind of stuff - it's in their popular culture. Thank god I'm not a
tax accountant. Thank god for tax accountants, but I'm so glad I'm not
one.</p><p>All that is funny and I will convert Cole to accept coral
and light-blue into his life. And he will accept the fact that the
Dolphins are a part of his future.</p><p>I have another very special
person. My wife Julie is an amazing sole. Another person who has been
who has been with me on this journey at ZD is Melanie Kranz. She has
been by my side since day one. It's been a great thing to have her
insight and her partnership in helping to guide the business - she's
been a funny, good influence. We went to high school together and we've
known each other our whole lives. It's fun.</p><p>I really hope we can
make a difference with the Dolphins. Every place tries to find their
story - what makes them who they are. Even if you're brand new you've
got a story. A lot of places don't really celebrate that story very
much. I think where we have been successful is telling authentic,
truthful, visual stories that immediately lend an air of legitimacy to
where you are.</p><p><strong>MC:</strong>What would you say is Madison's story if you had to boil it down?</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong>
I think it is Madison is the Midwest celebration of values and quality
of life. It's definitely a celebration of life - there's a bubble
around us. Drive to DeForest and you'll know what I'm talking about.
Drive anywhere around here. I bring people here from around the country
to work here. They all read Outsider magazine - number one place to
bike, and the like. Most romantic city? What was that? I don't know one
person in this city who could say, 'Oh yeah, I see that.' But there's
romance in State Street at the right hours.</p><p>It's hard to say
what's Madison's story. It's very much of a Midwest European - is there
such a thing? Because that's what it's like in a way. There are Midwest
and global tones on every corner of this city. That's really true.
Growing up here, like you did, you've seen how this place has gone from
where you walk in and used to know everybody in the room. And now you
walk in and you don't know anybody in the room. And you think, 'Where
did all these people come from?' I mean, where did all these joggers
come from? All these bikes come from, boats come from, laptops come
from? It's a unique celebration of modern culture with its
honest-as-the-day-is-long work ethic. One thing is for sure, nobody is
going to outwork me, ever.</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> You recently ran a marathon?</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong>
I just ran my first marathon 60 days ago. That was a big thing. My wife
Julie and I decided in June that we were going to run a marathon. We
had no idea why, but we were going to run a marathon. We decided in
June and ran it in December - our first marathon. That's part of that
drive to create.</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> Where'd you run?</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> In Las Vegas.</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> Why on earth?</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong>
I will never go to Las Vegas again. I hate the smell. I hate the
people. Every inch of it is bad. But you know what? It was incredible
because we started at the Mandalay Bay at 6 a.m. There were fireworks
going off, Celine Dion singing, Muhammad Ali shoots the gun off and
15,000 people. It's pitch black, 38 degrees, and we run all the way up
the Las Vegas strip for eight miles. Outside the Bellagio the fountain
show is on and there's music and you're running the strip into a
straight 20-mile-an-hour head wind - it's an absolute out-of-body
experience.</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> What made you decide to do it?</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong>
At 42 years old I think I thought I was losing my mojo. I had to get my
body back to where my body needed to be. I've been absolutely athletic
my whole life, extremely athletic. All the stress of business and kids
and clients and employees and parking - and I just started thinking
that my body was going to hell. So I just had to go to a place and do
something I've never been able to do physically in my whole life. And
so my greatest physical accomplishment was at 42 years old and I'm
going to do another one. I'm going to do Chicago in October. It might
become an annual event, to keep your body and mind healthy and keep it
in balance with all the work you have to do all the time.</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> You enjoyed the marathon?</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong>
In training I ran 20 miles - out to Epic in Verona and back. And I
remember somebody saying that anybody can do 20 miles. It's the last
6.2 that kill you. And it's true. Mile 23 is not your friend. When you
get to mile 23, you're speaking French, you don't even know where you
are anymore, you can't feel anything, and yet you feel everything. It's
totally delirious. You're eating bananas without peeling them, you're
extremely out of your mind. And all you care about is 26.2. You start
losing your mind. That was cool.</p><p>You have to have a little crisis
in your life. It's a damaging thing. You have to really want to prove
something. It's not healthy at mile 23. It's like, why do you climb a
mountain, because it's there. It's a goal that you set that is not
about work, your kids, your spouse - you don't have to take care of
anything but yourself. Running becomes a friend after a while. It's a
place you get to go where the phone's not ringing, nobody's around you,
you don't have a deadline, it's your friend.</p><p>Thank god for iPod
technology because you can create your whole mix. And you hydrate like
hell and take care of your body, and all of a sudden you feel good. You
make better choices about what you eat, drink, about your day - it
becomes a really good friend. And then the absolute most wonderful
feeling you'll ever have in your whole life is the start of your first
marathon. Better than anything you can imagine. But then the finish was
the most pain and the joy at the right-same time, bam. In a way,
running the second one will be kind of a bummer.</p><p>We're in the age
group now, Melanie, where we do something for everybody else. If you
get to do this - you're all you. You have to do it. When you're there
you realize that more people run first marathons than you thought.
Because it's that one thing that seems unachievable that you go do.</p><p>My
father died at 54 of alcoholism. I was 30. It's the absolute saddest
story that I know. I still start to pick up the phone to call him and
that was 13 years ago. But my kids know him, even though they didn't
know him. I talk about him all the time.</p><p>The Schmitz family was
extremely close to the Doyle family. I was talking to Jim Doyle last
summer and he said to me, "I had more dinners in your dad's house than
I did in my house. Your grandma cooked me more meals than my mother."
They grew up right on Chandler in Vilas, right near Judge Doyle. He was
the backdoor neighbor.</p><p>And my grandmother, right before she died,
said, "Mark, I think little Jimmy Doyle is going to be governor." Can
you believe that? She raised him. To this day, whenever I see him it's
a big high-five and talk about those were the best days. It was the
'50s, bucolic 'we-just-got-a-new-washing-machine and it's electric'
kind of times. That's where Jim Doyle grew up in the Vilas Neighborhood
and it was as pristine, and beautiful and family-driven and
church-driven and community driven and that's what Madison is about.
It's still that way. But only in the iPod Nation - it's a different
time.</p><p>Dave Cieslewicz - I have a story there too. His wife, is my
aunt's sister. I'm related to him. He's my ... he would be ... what
would he be? I don't know, but at family weddings, my cousin Katie who
would have been his niece was married in San Francisco about two years
ago. I had met him because of the State Street stuff. We walk into the
church and both of us at the same time say, "What are you doing here?"
We hadn't put it together that we were related. It was really funny.
From the governor to the mayor - it's a whole strange thing. That's the
funny thing about Madison.</p><p>Madison - you had to go away to come
back. From the day I left, Jan. 1st, 1988, driving out to Colorado with
$300 in my pocket in a Honda Civic with 100,000 miles on it and a
drawing table in the back. That's it. I started from there - literally
on that day started the rest of my life. And driving out of town. By
the time I got to Mt. Horeb, I was trying to figure out a way to get
back to Madison. I gotta start a life, become a professional, get
married and then find a way to get back here. It took me five years,
but I got back here.</p><p>And I'm never leaving. It's a good town. A good place to be.</p>
