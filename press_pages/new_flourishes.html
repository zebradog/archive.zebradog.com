State Street's proposed $15 million facelift is getting more nips and
tucks, including a circular logo to help market Madison's most famous
street.<p> Light poles with color-coded banners identifying each block
of State Street, colorful mosaics at the intersections and a grander
Capitol entrance are part of the latest plans to revamp the showcase
street that runs from the Capitol to UW-Madison.</p><p> The designs and
the proposed logo - a simple circle that says "State Street" - will be
presented at a public meeting Sept. 11. The final concept still needs
approval from the Madison City Council.</p><p> "State Street is the
most important street in the city, and I'm very excited about what's
been presented," said Ken Opin, chairman of the State Street Design
Project Oversight Committee, which met Thursday.</p>
        <p><br>
          The committee and a new set of engineers and designers are making changes 
          to a conceptual design that was approved last year by the City Council.</p>
        <p> One change includes saving many of the trees along State Street, instead 
          of chopping them down.</p>
        <p> Another feature is a logo, to help brand the funky street of restaurants 
          and shops.</p>
        <p> Mark Schmitz of ZD Studios, who designed the logo, said it's not meant 
          to be an icon representing all of State Street.</p>
        <p> "It's a graphic thumbprint," Schmitz said.</p>
        <p> It's likely to be used small, on banners, signs and even on tree grates, 
          he said.</p>
        <p> The latest designs include a plaza-like space at the start of State 
          Street near the Capitol, with a raised pavement and no curbs, said Ken 
          Saiki, a Madison landscape architect.</p>
        <p> "It should expand the event space, for the Farmer's Market or Jazz 
          at Five," Saiki said.</p>
        <p> Potted plants and trees will help separate the pedestrian area from 
          the street, he said.</p>
        <p> Bus shelters will be smaller and use more glass. Public art will be 
          incorporated throughout the street. And street lamps will include a 
          banner system to help people identify with each block of State Street.</p>
        <p> "I think the average person doesn't have each block face memorized, 
          if something is the 200 or 400 block," City Council President Mike Verveer 
          said. "Signage has been less than impressive in the past."</p>
        <p> There will also be directional signs, pointing to places of interest, 
          such as the Madison Children's Museum, UW-Madison and the future Overture 
          Center.</p>
        <p> "This is the first I've seen these new designs and I'm very impressed," 
          Verveer said. "I'm anxious to get reaction from the public."</p>
        <p> A final design is expected to be approved by the end of this year, 
          with construction to start on the 100 block of State Street next year. 
          The 200 block -- the site of the Overture Center -- will follow in 2005.</p>
        <p> City planner Bill Fruhling said the timeline for the rest of the State 
          Street hasn't been determined.</p>
        <p> He also said last year's price tag of $15 million is only an estimate, 
          and it will probably cost less when the plans are finalized.</p>
