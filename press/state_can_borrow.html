				<br>
Just days after Madison Mayor Dave Cieslewicz presented his plan for a
"healthy city," ripe with well-paying jobs and happy citizens, Forbes
magazine gave the city an unexpected salute, ranking Mad Town No. 1 in
the country for business. Forbes focused on Madison's high proportion
of college-educated adults and its 2.7 percent unemployment rate -- the
lowest of any metro area studied.<br>
				<br>
Forbes' ranking gave Mayor Dave a boost just as grumblings from the
business community were beginning to mount over the city's smoking ban
and minimum-wage hike. It also meshed well with the mayor's "<a href="http://www.ci.madison.wi.us/mayor/Biomedical%20Coll%20Doc_042404.pdf">Biomedical Collaborative</a>"
plan, which aims to strengthen the ties between Madison's medical and
biotechnology communities. It envisions a "Health Care Main Street"
along Park Street and University Avenue in Madison not too far from
Camp Randall. This "main street" would be created by focusing medical
development near existing facilities like UW Hospital and Clinics, Dean
Health System and Meriter Hospital.<br>
				<br> The overall goal is
to bring in outside capital and position Madison as a national
biomedical leader, a plan that can only be helped by Forbes'
recognition.<br>

					<br>
				</font></b><font size="2">MILWAUKEE
&#8211; "It's Miller Time" all the time in the auditorium at the Miller
Brewing visitor's center, but on Wednesday afternoon about 60 people in
the room seemed to reach a consensus that it's time to do a better job
of branding Wisconsin.<br>
				<br> The event was the second Branding
Wisconsin forum. Hosted by WisBusiness.com, Forward Wisconsin, and the
Small Business Times, it focused on branding success stories. <br>
				<br>
Panelists Mark Schmitz, Z-D Studios in Madison; Scott Silvestri, Kohler
Company; Steve Flatt, Miller Brewing; Tom Farley, Chris Farley
Foundation and Mark Vachon, GE Healthcare, joined Michael Armiak of
Forward Wisconsin and audience members in discussing whether an entire
state or region can adopt branding methods successfully used by
corporations, unions and non-profit entities.<br>

		<p align="left"><font size="2"><b>STATE RANKINGS SHOW WISCONSIN SLIPPING</b></font><br><br><font size="2">Recent
studies point toward problems with promoting Wisconsin as a state on
the nation's economic leading edge. Minnesota rose and Wisconsin fell
in the Milken Institute's state-by-state new economy rankings. And
Competitive Wisconsin's annual "measuring success" report suggests big
hurdles must be overcome for Wisconsin to move quickly up the economic
ladder. The annual "Tax Freedom Day'' rankings show Wisconsin isn't
quite the "tax hell'' it used to be, but the state is still ranked 11th
(and 6th in terms of paying off state-local taxes). Even when it comes
to staples, Wisconsin is second in milk and might lose its preeminent
ranking as the big cheese state soon. Cranberry now is the official
state fruit, but how does that help Wisconsin become a new economic
magnet? Some insiders are becoming gloomy over state economic prospects
and wonder how the former "star of the snow belt'' has fallen. They
murmur that a dramatic breakthrough is needed on the image front or
that Wisconsin needs to partner with other Midwest states for more
regional punch.</font></p>

<p><br><font size="2"><b>FREE BRANDING: STATE PICKS AGRICULTURAL THEME FOR STATE QUARTER</b><br><br>Shortly
after the WisBusiness panel convened, the state had an opportunity for
some free branding, courtesy of the U.S. Mint. Wisconsin's
commemorative quarter comes out in October 2004, and the state had to
send in its design by Oct. 1, 2003. Public Internet voters favored an
agricultural design, depicting a cow's head, corn and a wedge of
cheese, while a special committee favored an early exploration theme.
Gov. Doyle sided with the public and forwarded the agricultural design
to the mint.<br><br>Before the decision was made, Dick Bohling,
government affairs manager for Verizon, echoed the concerns of some in
the state in an e-mail to WisBusiness:<br><br><i>If you, and the other
interested parties, are really concerned about the "Cheesehead" image,
I recommend that you take a close look at the proposed Wisconsin
"Quarters" that the Department of Financial Institutions is going to
recommend to the US Mint very soon. If they choose the Agriculture
model, it will brand Wisconsin as the "Cheesehead" state for years to
come.</i><br><br>News:</font></p>

<p><font size="2"><b>I-Q CORRIDOR: THE MIDWEST'S SILICON VALLEY</b><br><br>Earlier
in 2003, the Wisconsin Technology Council announced its own branding
initiative for the state, dubbing the space between Chicago and the
Twin Cities the "I-Q Corridor." The branding push will focus on
Wisconsin but include Chicago and the Twin Cities, which are roughly
the same distance apart as San Diego and San Francisco, the two
endpoints of Silicon Valley. <br><br>The "I" in the title has multiple
meanings, representing the interstate highways (I-90, I-94 and I-43)
that criscross the state as well as the innovation taking place here,
according to Tom Still, Tech Council president. The "Q" stands for
quality, as in schools, workers, lifestyle and environment -- all
factors that can draw people here. And taken together, "I-Q" is
shorthand for the knowledge economy, reminding prospective investors
that the upper Midwest can be an area to develop and grow so-called
"new economy" companies.<br><br>See more: <a href="http://www.i-qcorridor.com/">http://www.i-qcorridor.com/</a><br></font></p><br>
