On Sept. 7, when more than 70,000 football fans crowd into Lambeau
Field to watch the Green Bay Packers take on the Minnesota Vikings,
they'll find the work of a Madison visual designer waiting for them.<p>
The stadium's new 1930s style logo and graphics come from a small firm
that is putting its designs on some of the state's best-known sites.</p><p>
Lambeau Field is just one stop on a Wisconsin tour that has taken Mark
Schmitz and his 13 employees at ZD Studios from State Street in
Milwaukee to State Street in Madison. ZD Studios, 111 S. Hamilton St.,
has created images for the Miller Brewing Co.'s visitor center and tour
in Milwaukee. In September, Schmitz will be unveiling a new State
Street logo to accompany the redesign of Madison's favorite
thoroughfare.</p><p> It's a kind of professional homecoming for
Schmitz, 40, a grandson of one of the founders of American Family
Insurance in Madison and a graduate of Madison Area Technical College's
commercial art program.</p>
        <p><br>
          "In many ways our work has been out of the state for many years," said 
          Schmitz, whose clients from outside Wisconsin include companies such 
          as Westin Hotels &amp; Resorts of White Plains, N.Y.</p>
        <p> The designer's dreams, however, have stayed in Wisconsin.</p>
        <p> For 28 years, Schmitz carried in his wallet an autographed menu that 
          legendary Packers quarterback Bart Starr had given him as a boy. When 
          ZD Studios received the logo design contract in 1999, Schmitz had a 
          chance to draw on memories of his childhood idol.</p>
        <p> Fit into the same oval shape as the Packers' signature "G," the Lambeau 
          Field logo shows a quarterback in an old-style leather helmet, his right 
          arm cocked and ready to throw. The player, Schmitz said, is "part (current 
          Packers quarterback) Brett Favre, part Bart Starr and a little bit of 
          Johnny Unitas."</p>
        <p> The logo and the $295 million renovation of the stadium, built in 
          1957, seek to tout Lambeau's claims to football history and make it 
          into a year-round destination for Packers fans. Team executives have 
          said they hope the changes will help the Packers remain competitive 
          by generating $23 million to $30 million in additional revenue for the 
          franchise.</p>
        <p> The logo's "been exactly what we were looking for," said Packers president 
          and chief executive officer Bob Harlan, who had wanted to evoke the 
          early days of the National Football League. "The more (Schmitz) did 
          the more it appealed to us," Harlan said in a telephone interview.</p>
        <p> In the end, ZD Studios designed not just the Lambeau logo but locator 
          graphics and images for concession stands, retailers and a 20,000 square-foot 
          restaurant. More than 2,000 graphics and photographs are being installed 
          everywhere from Harlan's office to the Packers Hall of Fame to stadium 
          restrooms. Schmitz even wrote guidelines for the stadium's advertisers 
          so their images would reinforce the 1930s look.</p>
        <p> "I think what makes it unique is that the Packers are really tying 
          together a theme for the whole stadium," said Kelly Huggett, a marketing 
          specialist for Coca-Cola in Chicago, who hired Schmitz to do Coke's 
          Lambeau Field advertising.</p>
        <p> Schmitz won't say what the Packers paid for his work, but it's clear 
          the contract has led to other sports projects for his firm, which had 
          sales of $250,000 in 1994 and $2.5 million in 2002. Vince Sweeney, senior 
          associate athletic director for UW-Madison, said ZD Studios would design 
          a logo, signs and graphics for the renovated Camp Randall Stadium that 
          will open in its first phase in the fall of 2004.</p>
        <p> "We hope to piggyback upon that and employ (Schmitz) to help us in 
          our overall efforts to sell suites and club seats," Sweeney added.</p>
        <p> Though Schmitz has other dreams, like designing brand images for an 
          entire Olympics, he said the Lambeau Field project has been unlike any 
          other. Schmitz never imagined he would have the chance, as he did Sunday, 
          to take his sons, Riley, 7, and Cole, 5, to Lambeau Field and stand 
          with them in the south end zone, looking up at his own logo on the new 
          scoreboard.</p>
        <p> "They think they're Brett Favre right now and I thought I was Bart 
          Starr," Schmitz said, remembering how it felt to watch his boys sprint 
          across his hero's home field, "I almost started crying."</p>
