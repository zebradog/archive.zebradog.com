			<p></p><h1 class="storyHead">Designing man</h1>
			<h4 class="byline">Interviewed by Nathan Leaf</h4>
			
			Q. Why did you choose design as a career?<br><br>A.
I was born to do this. I knew what I was going to do when I was in
second grade. When my teacher at Odana Elementary School put my drawing
out in the big glass case out in the hallway, I knew what I was going
to do. I was an illustrator in college. I have been a visualist all of
my life. So this is what I was supposed to do. <br><br>Q. What was it about having your drawing in that glass case that was so exciting?<br><br>A.
I think it was the fact that other human beings experienced it. So I
have been in the business of creating images for people to experience
since I was in second grade.<br><br>Q. Why did you decide to leave UW-Madison just one semester short of a degree?<br><br>A.
I realized that I wanted to practice design as a professional and that
a bachelor's degree wasn't going to let me do anything other than
teach. So I made a decision at that time to transfer to MATC and get an
associate's degree in commercial art, which actually trained me to go
and be a professional designer. It was with that degree that I got my
first job in Denver, Colo.<br><br>Q. What does ZD Studios do?<br><br>A.
We do visual brand design at the highest level, at the Web level and at
the facility level. We work very closely with architects and designers
every day, and owners. So we kind of take what has been defined as a
brand identity program and we visualize it. We're working with the
owner (of the company), with the developer, with the project managers,
with the interior designers, with the food and beverage people. And
what we do is create the visual thread that holds the entire experience
together.<br><br>Q. What's your work day like?<br><br>A. Constant
communication. From 6 in the morning until 7 at night I talk. I talk
all day long. I talk and I write. Working with eight designers here,
counseling them on the individual projects that they're working on,
helping to guide the creative process to an end. I'm constantly
communicating with clients all day long and other professional staff
here in terms of our process. It can go from a coffee company to a
credit union to a National Football League stadium to a Major League
Baseball stadium in five minutes. It's unbelievably diverse. <br><br>Q. Where do you go to unwind after those hectic days?<br><br>A.
Barriques is a place where I kind of hang out and drink red wine. I've
got a fort over at Barriques -- it's just a private sanctuary. That's
been my kind of place to think and write, kind of be away from work and
family and everything else. But frankly, after work I go to work. Three
kids in the summertime is a full-time job. So there's really no
downtime of any kind.<br><br>Q. What are your goals at ZD Studios?<br><br>A.
We expect to be in to the $5 million revenue range within the next
three years. We've got a strategic plan that will carry us through more
stadium work. We'll probably be focusing a lot more on a full stadium
experience whether it's an arena in Boston or a professional baseball
field in Washington, D.C., or a professional football stadium in Dallas
or whatever it might be. We're really focusing hard on guest
experiences.<br><br>Q. Why have you made guest experience a focus?<br><br>A.
Because it involves all your senses. We are not an advertising agency.
We are not a print design firm. We are sort of an experience design
firm. Part of the experience is being in a facility. We really work
very hard to work with the human emotion of connecting to a brand at
the facility level. So you have interactive stuff. You've got kiosk
design work. You've got signing. You've got training staff and wardrobe
selections. It's very diverse, which is why we wanted to do stadium
stuff.<br><br>Q. Is that how the firm started out?<br><br>A. No, absolutely not. We were purely a corporate identity firm. Logos, logos, logos. Millions of logos.<br><br>Q. Why did you make the switch?<br><br>A.
After you design every logo in the state, you really got to figure out
what else you're going to do. It's like anything. If you're not
growing, you're dying.<br><br>Q. Do you have any number in mind as far as how big you would like the firm to be?<br><br>A.
We'll be at $5 million in probably two to three years. We'll be at 25
people and that will be the end. My grandfather always said, "You'll
only have one problem the rest of your life and it will be your staff."
The more people you have, the more problems that you have that are not
related to what you're supposed to be doing. Staff equals emotional
pain. But they are all so dear to me and we're all such great friends
and we all have such a great working routine together that we are as
good as our people are. ... When you have a building full of creative
souls, there's a lot of energy going on. Some days it's great and some
days it's less than that.<br><br>Q. What big project is ZD working on right now?<br><br>A.
I'll just say without saying names that we have two National Football
League projects that we're working on right now. We'll release that
soon.<br><br>Q. What are the keys to your growth?<br><br>A. The keys to
that growth are people. Design and project management professionals
that can expand their capabilities to deal with the size and scope of
some of these projects. There are not a lot of people in the country
that do this. There is no one (else) in the state of Wisconsin that is
doing this right now. We are clearly unique at that level. We are able
to expand based on the quality of professionals that work here.<br><br>Q. What do you like about doing business in Madison?<br><br>A.
It's the greatest city in the world. The pace here is extremely
comfortable. It's home to me so I feel natural here. I feel truthful
here. If I had set up shop in Boulder, Colo., I wouldn't feel grounded.
I feel very grounded in Madison.<br><br>Q. What don't you like about working in Madison?<br><br>A. There's connecting flights all the time. That's a pain. We need more direct flights.<br><br>Q. What have been your greatest triumphs?<br><br>A.
The ability to change. The ability to grow. A lot of design agencies
get specialized in something and they can't get out of it and grow. The
fact that we've been around for (so long) is my greatest triumph.<br><br>Q. Can you see the company evolving again?<br><br>A.
Oh, absolutely. Twenty-four months from now we'll be totally different
from who we are today. We have to constantly reinvent our products and
our service. The only thing that never changes is the absolute passion
for what I do.<br><br>Q. What have been your biggest mistakes?<br><br>A. Being too passionate and sometimes not having the foresight to stop a train that's going down a track.<br><br>Q. How has that hurt you?<br><br>A.
We give so much to projects that are perhaps being formed or developed
and for many reasons, not having to do with us, they don't happen. So
you invest so much time and money and emotion in a project that doesn't
happen. That really, really hurts because we can't sustain that kind of
loss. A company this size can't invest a lot of time in a lot of places
without things actually turning into revenue.<br><br>Q. Is there anything you would have done differently during your career as a manager?<br><br>A.
Probably having better organizational skills, more staff organizational
skills. I would have liked to have learned that earlier that people do
need management. People need to be accountable. We're in a world here
where everyone is treated as an adult and they are responsible for
their own product and process and sometimes that doesn't work as well
as having a manager where you know this is due at this time.<br><br>Q. What do you do when you're not working?<br><br>A.
Right now I'm training for my second marathon. I just ran my first one
in December in Las Vegas and I'm training to run the Chicago Marathon
at the end of October. I'm really focused on running lately. Golf is an
extreme passion of mine so I play as often as I can. I'm a six-handicap
right now. The family is real active in baseball, football, basketball,
tennis, golf and swimming and water ballet and everything in between.<br><a href="mailto:nleaf@madison.com">nleaf@madison.com</a>
