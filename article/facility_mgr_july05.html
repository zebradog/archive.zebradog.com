      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The &#8220;art&#8221; of creating special 
      human places has been around a few thousand years, but the practice has 
      never been more important than now in the quest for the ultimate guest 
      experience. Believe it or not, your facility is being judged by every 
      ticket holder, vendor, maintenance worker and employee in the building. 
      You see, the facility &#8220;experience&#8221; has become such an important part of 
      our culture that any success you enjoy in the future depends on your 
      creating that experience. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The next time you walk into 
      your facility, pretend it&#8217;s for the first time. What do you see? What 
      don&#8217;t you see? How do you know where to go? What does it smell like? What 
      sounds do you hear? How integrated is your brand identity to the space? 
      Does the room &#8220;feel&#8221; right? </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">These are questions and 
      thoughts everyone has and the answers are closer than you think. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Your facility can be an 
      all-in-one VISUALLY INTEGRATED space with the infusion of a coordinated 
      identity, signing and theme program. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Walking into a brand new and 
      well-designed facility can be refreshing and uplifting, interesting, 
      entertaining and educational. But you don&#8217;t have to be &#8220;brand new&#8221; to 
      create a brand new and integrated visual experience. Visual brand 
      integration is the key to success for any public facility, new or old. The 
      integration between architecture and interior design is critical. We call 
      it &#8220;Placemaking&#8221; and it works to bring your facility up to full 
      utilization without spending a fortune on new construction. </font></p>

      How To Get Started <br>
      <img border="0" src="facility_mgr_files/sm3.jpg" width="189" height="138" align="right"></b></i></font>You 
      want to present your guests with a visual experience that celebrates our 
      way of living, playing, competing and of course ... buying stuff. It 
      starts with a dynamic logo identity and builds from there. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">
      <img border="0" src="facility_mgr_files/sm1.jpg" width="199" height="109" align="left">Your 
      logo is one of the most successful line item profit pools within your 
      facility. In a sports arena, it&#8217;s a fingerprint to the world that 
      thousands of people want to wear. Our culture celebrates and acknowledges 
      sports unlike any other culture on earth. American sports fanatics live 
      vicariously through the identity of their favorite stadium or arena. We 
      claim it as our own. We connect to our heroes. We revel in that victorious 
      feeling.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"> <img border="0" src="facility_mgr_files/sm2.jpg" width="167" height="209" align="right">&#8220;Non-game 
      day&#8221; has become the direct focus of developers, owners and facility 
      managers. The need to create positive revenue streams on off days is 
      critical to a sports franchise&#8217;s survival. The glory of your venue's 
      visual brand stands at the middle of that effort. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">If you work within the 
      destination resort, golf or indoor water park industries, your logo 
      directly evokes emotions of an experience shared between guests. There is 
      enormous power in that identity. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#009900"><i><b>
      Developing Your Logo </b></i></font><br>
      1) Your logo needs to evoke an emotional response in your audience. You 
      can carefully control that response with effective imagery and consistent 
      frequency. <br>
      2) Keep it simple. The most effective marks are the ones that have the 
      fewest graphic elements. Think of your logo as the period at the end of 
      your sentence. <br>
      3) Your logo is only as effective as the collateral that surrounds it. Put 
      significant thought into each application where your logo is used, 
      including signage, stationery, your web site and apparel. A quality brand 
      can be killed with bad detailing and inconsistent background colors and 
      materials. <br>
      4) Make sure a professional design firm develops your mark. This is 
      critical. Yes, you do get what you pay for and a professional design firm 
      will deliver a style and usage guide critical to any logo&#8217;s ongoing 
      success. <br>
      5) Your logo is an investment, not an expense. It is often the first 
      contact with your customer and first impressions count. With time and 
      frequency your visual brand will pay enormous psychological and financial 
      dividends. Be patient. The road to brand recognition is long. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#009900"><i><b>
      Beyond The Mark</b></i></font> <br>
      The visual sophistication of the American consumer is extremely high. You 
      must constantly be developing ways to &#8220;plus&#8221; your brand image. You&#8217;re in 
      the entertainment biz, right down to the soap in the soap dish. Consumers 
      are smart and their expectations are high. You must exceed their 
      expectations at all times. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#009900"><i><b>
      The Care And Feeding Of Your Visual Brand </b></i></font><br>
      Developing a graphic standards and usage program for your logo and visual 
      collateral is critical to the success of your investment. It should go 
      into great detail on proper usage of a logo in signage, printed materials, 
      advertising and web animated applications, etc. There should be a section 
      dedicated to &#8220;living the lifestyle&#8221; of the brand. Here we go beyond usage 
      and color to educate people on what emotional stimuli should surround the 
      mark. This is critical for the development of unique image vehicles you 
      can use to feed your brand. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#009900"><i><b>
      Playing Off A 1930&#8217;s Style Leather Football Helmet </b></i></font><br>
      <img border="0" src="facility_mgr_files/sm4.jpg" width="203" height="180" align="right">For 
      example, the newly renovated Lambeau Field is the first &#8220;retro&#8221; styled 
      stadium designed in the NFL and the Green Bay Packers may be the only team 
      in the NFL who could have pulled it off. The history, tradition and legend 
      that make Packer football so special had to be graphically fulfilled 
      throughout the $295 million renovated stadium. Since 1919, local fan 
      shareholders have fully owned the team. A graphic standards program was 
      developed that sponsors had to follow in order to place their advertising 
      in the facility. The plan called for special color pallets, typestyles and 
      imagery that tied all sponsors to the central visual theme of the stadium. 
      Hard nosed, leather helmet football. Looking back to the days when a torn 
      ACL was considered a limp. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">It&#8217;s important to avoid &#8220;The 
      Tradeshow Effect,&#8221; where colors, messages and imagery clash like those on 
      a tradeshow floor. Sponsors need to be convinced to follow an image plan. 
      Having their brands associated with Green Bay Packers football in one of 
      the most significant stadiums in professional sports is already paying off 
      for them. The concourses, restrooms, executive offices, team spaces, 
      restaurants and concessions all sing in visual harmony. This is the 
      ultimate in effective visual brand symmetry. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#009900"><i><b>
      Wayfinding <br>
      </b></i></font>While the art of directing people to places they want to go 
      has been around a while, recent statistical data shows us how critical it 
      is as part of an overall guest and brand experience. Wayfinding (or public 
      signing) is a broad subject. In any atmosphere it should enhance the 
      architecture, be placed on common sight lines and most importantly, be 
      legible and meaningful. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#009900"><i><b>
      Space: Delivering The Promise </b></i></font><br>
      A strong interior graphic design program uses exhibits, public signage, 
      banners, ad panels, themed concessions, landscape architecture and more to 
      surround your guests in the revenue streams and culture you want to 
      control. Tell your story &#8211; your history and your successes. Be 
      &#8220;authenticated&#8221; wherever you can be. Use your blank walls to show your 
      truth in purposeful ways. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The new Lambeau Field captures 
      you throughout the entire space. From the parking lot to the 50-yard line, 
      the glory that is Green Bay Packer football is being kept alive for 
      generations to come. Special attention was placed in the team spaces 
      including the tunnel to the field. Quotes and photos from past players and 
      coaches were used to blanket the walls. The seven most historic plays ever 
      to happen on Lambeau Field are featured on the walk from the locker room 
      to the field inspiring all who make the journey. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#009900"><i><b>
      &#8220;Edutaining&#8221; Your Tour Visitors </b></i></font><br>
      Showing off your facility to your public is the ultimate form of brand 
      reinforcement. Miller Brewing Company has developed the ultimate 
      &#8220;Edutaining&#8221; tour. They educate while entertaining guests in the second 
      largest brewing facility in the world. A fully renovated campus with 
      historic horse stables, brew houses and beer gardens welcomes all to a 
      fully integrated story. The image plan is a journey that provides a 
      moving, dynamic, rich history ending up with an ice cold product sample in 
      your hand.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">A visual branding team can 
      make your facility come alive with fresh approaches to living and 
      experiencing your brand. Trust in the power of your story even if you are 
      a start-up or don&#8217;t have a 100-year history. Your story is your power and 
      it must be put on display every chance you get from your parking lots to 
      your executive offices. Your facility is the single greatest tool you have 
      for success.</font></p><p align="left">
